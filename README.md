Hello Fellow Internet Explorer, 

My name is Preston Messina, going by pretzel online, I am 16 years old and I create sites, games, simulations, and other cool stuff using my Programming and CAD skills. 

In the real world I pursue my interest for robotics where I am the team captain for Triton Tech, the FTC team at my hightschool, and where I am on the Mecanical and CAD subteams for Grizzly Gears, the FRC team located at and hosted by Georgian College.

I also enjoy playing music where i play alto saxophone for Triton Music, the concert band at my hightschool.

Overall, look around my page and check out what ive been building and creating!
